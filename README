This package contains the source code for a WebAssembly decoder (and very simple player) for
WavPack files. This version is built on top of the WavPack Tiny Decoder, so it will not decode
(very old) version 3 files. This will also not decode DSD WavPack files.

The main WebAssembly code is written in C and emscripten is used to generate the WebAssembly
output. Javascript is used to communicate with the WebAssembly code.

To compile the C code, you can look at the included mybuild.bat file, though obviously this 
would need to be modified to point at the location on your local machine to emcc (Emscripten
compiler).
This will generate 2 files, wavpack.js and wavpack.wasm

mywavpack.htm is the main HTML file, this is the one you should load to try out the decoder.
Note this is extremely basic!
This HTML file calls mywavpack.js which is the main JavaScript code, this calls the 
WebAssembly code. 
This HTML file has to be called via a web server, due to security issues it will not work by
simply opening the file with your web browser - however you can call it from any webserver 
including one on your own machine - for development purposes I used one from python, called 
(in the directory where I have all these files) with:
python -m http.server

mywavpack uses a simple 'hack' in order to allow the WebAssembly code to read the contents of
the WavPack file you choose to play, it makes a copy of the file which is in the correct 
security context that the WebAssembly file can read from.
The buffer it uses to retrieve the decoded PCM data is shared with the WebAssembly code - I
use a malloc in the code to reserve a small amount of memory - I don't use a corresponding 
'free' as this reserved memory gets re-used if you load/play subsequent WavPack files.

My code is built on top of the WavPack tiny decoder, however this could probably be modified 
to use the full WavPack source code if you wanted to!
